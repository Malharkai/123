1
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,099
Hey... What's that song?

2
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,180
Cut! Cut!
Who let that creep in here?

3
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,979
Spongers!

4
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,780
Throw him the hell out of here!
What do we pay you for?

5
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:04,780
SERGEI BODROV

6
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,379
-Your name?
- Bagrov.

7
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,979
Danila Sergeyevich.

8
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,579
Born 1975.
Station Street, 22.

9
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,579
- Place of work?
- Haven't finished being demobbed yet.

10
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,780
-Where did you serve?
- In the army.

11
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,579
-Want to work for us?
- No.

12
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:46,979
You broke their security guy's arm.
And nearly took his eye out.

13
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:50,300
If you'd been drunk,
I'd have arrested you.

14
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,780
Get outta here!

15
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:58,579
If you don't get a job within a week,
I'll put you on probation.

16
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:08,780
VIKTOR SUKHORUKOV

17
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:31,979
I really broke his arm?

18
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,579
No. Just dislocated it.

19
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,180
And that guy who was screaming?
Who is he?

20
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,979
The director.

21
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:03,180
-And what was that song?
- ''Wings'' by Nautilus.

22
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,099
SVETLANA PISMICHENKO

23
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:20,699
Sergei Bagrov,
born 1942,

24
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,779
...repeat convictions for burglary.

25
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:26,779
He was killed in a prison camp
in January '82.

26
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,579
He was my classmate.

27
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,899
YURI KUZNETSOV

28
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,180
Do you have ''Wings'' by Nautilus?
The CD?

29
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:51,300
Whadda you want? Get out of here,
or I'll call the police.

30
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:57,779
VYACHESLAV BUTUSOV

31
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:07,579
You could at least chop wood
ratherthan sticking your neck out.

32
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,980
Would have been betterto stay
in the army.

33
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,379
Here they'll probably kill you,
idiot.

34
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:15,579
Always turning on that metal of yours.

35
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:21,579
You'll croak in prison
like your good-for-nothing father.

36
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:30,100
The only hope I have
is my little Viktor.

37
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,980
He's a big man there, you know,
in Leningrad.

38
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,579
Just look at these. So little.
How cute you all were.

39
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:53,980
-Just look.
- I've seen them.

40
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,779
Take another look.

41
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,980
You had better go to your brother
in Leningrad.

42
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,180
I'll die soon, you know,
and he's to you like father now.

43
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,379
This is your blood.

44
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:13,379
The closest person to you
in this world.

45
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,980
My little Viktor.

46
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:27,300
BROTHER

47
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,779
If you haven't seen Moscow,
you haven't seen much.

48
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,579
The Chechen was released.
We need to take him out.

49
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,300
He grabbed the whole market.

50
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,899
Says it was his.
He's collecting from our spots.

51
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,579
At the meet we agreed all peaceful,
like our people don't want war.

52
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,779
But he and Paramon are close...

53
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,379
The Chechen's going down!

54
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,980
In short, fifteen.

55
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,579
You know me. My prices are fair.

56
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,980
Fifteen...

57
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:16,100
That's good money, of course,
but forthe Chechen...

58
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,899
With him I'm risking my skull.

59
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,899
- How much?
- Twenty. And ten up front.

60
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,180
You get a week for prepwork.

61
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,579
Two.

62
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:52,779
The Tatar's becoming a wiseguy.

63
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,579
He took a lot up front.

64
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,379
You guys hang up at the market day
and night, and keep out of sight.

65
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:05,980
Bite off more than you can chew
and you wind up in the zoo.

66
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,379
- Do you have ''Wings'' by Nautilus?
- No. They go quickly.

67
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,580
But you stop in again. We should get
another shipment.

68
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,379
- Have you anything else?
- Of course.

69
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,379
Here's ''Titanic on the Fontanka''
with Grebenschikov.

70
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,379
And this is ''Ten-year Report''

71
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:09,580
Their best songs covered by friends.

72
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,580
How much they cost?

73
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,779
This one's 75,800. The other one's
78,000.

74
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:14,580
Well, what we selling, wino?

75
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:19,179
You got watches?

76
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,580
Well, my cut's fifty now.

77
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,779
From you, you fucking worm, I said!

78
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,379
And what did you think?
Taxes.

79
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,299
- But I haven't sold anything yet!
- I'm confiscating the goods.

80
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,179
But, sonny, ljust...
I haven't sold anything yet.

81
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,179
- I haven't sold anything!
-What's the difference?

82
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,580
The city?
The city's a frightening force.

83
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:07,980
And the biggerthe city,
the stronger it is.

84
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:12,580
It sucks you in.
Only the strong can climb out.

85
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,100
And even so...

86
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,379
-What's your name?
- Hoffman.

87
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,980
-What are you, a Jew?
- I'm German.

88
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:33,179
Oh... I'm not wild about Jews...

89
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,379
-And Germans?
- Germans? They're okay.

90
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,580
-What's the difference?
-Why you badgering me about it?

91
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:48,379
-Where have you taken me?
- My homeland.

92
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,100
My ancestors lie here.

93
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,379
Sit down.

94
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:07,179
- Here.
- Hold on.

95
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:09,779
What?

96
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,179
I brought a present for my brother.
I guess it wasn't to be.

97
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,299
Oh, gimme some of that...

98
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:40,179
She's a doll.

99
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,299
Hey, girl, what's your name?

100
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,299
Tickets, please.

101
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,379
No ticket.

102
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,580
Tickets, please.

103
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,980
No ticket.

104
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,580
Your tickets, please.

105
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:05,580
Listen, you Russian or what?

106
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:08,299
I'm saying to you in Russian:
no ticket.

107
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,580
Then pay the fine, please.

108
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:13,580
What fine, huh?
I'm an invalid.

109
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,580
You pay the fine or show me
your ticket.

110
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:22,379
Hey, take a load off your feet.
Sit down.

111
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,580
Well, if you haven't got tickets,
then you have to pay the fine.

112
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,379
Hey, don't you understand?

113
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,179
Come on, come on.

114
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,779
Pay the fine!

115
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,779
Brother, don't kill me!

116
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,980
The money,
take it all, take it!

117
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,179
Don't kill me, brother!

118
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:54,379
You're not my brother,
you blackassed worm!

119
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:59,700
- How much is the fine?
- Seven.

120
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:04,779
Run!

121
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,179
Hey, guys!
It's not ''Nora'', it's ''Norah''.

122
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,379
In short, you know, to get there
you've got to...

123
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,100
Bye!

124
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:10,580
Man, oh man, that's such a cool
Walkman! Let me listen.

125
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,580
Why you blasting this crap?
Have you got anything decent?

126
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,580
-Are you deaf or something?
- No.

127
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:28,379
Your Walkman's fine,
but you're dressed like a pig.

128
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,899
You got any acid?
Or dough?

129
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,580
Got any dough?
- No.

130
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:37,899
I'm Kat.
You can always find me here.

131
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,980
If you get some money, come here
and we'll get stoned. Well, later!

132
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,980
It's open!

133
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,900
On your knees! Hands out!

134
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:18,099
I'm looking for my brother.
Viktor Bagrov. He lived here.

135
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,099
I'm his younger brother.
Been in Leningrad two days.

136
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:26,180
My mom gave me his address:
Moika 1, apartment 8.

137
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,579
Well, hello, brother!

138
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:39,180
It's not Leningrad,
but St. Petersburg.

139
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:43,700
St. Pete's, for short.
A beautiful city, but a province.

140
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,380
Got to go to Moscow.
All the power's there.

141
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,579
I'll scrape it a little more here,
and then to Moscow.

142
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:54,980
- How's mom?
- Okay.

143
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,579
Here, she sent you this.

144
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,180
Come on, drink. I still got
some business to take care of.

145
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,579
This'll hold you over for awhile.

146
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,099
Get some nice clothes,
rent an apartment or a room.

147
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,779
Nothing over a hundred for now
and then we'll see.

148
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:41,579
- How was the army?
- Okay.

149
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:45,579
Mom wrote that you were in the war.

150
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,579
Nah. I sat things out at HQ.
I was a clerk.

151
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,180
Can you shoot?

152
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,779
Yeah, they took us out
to the shooting range.

153
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,900
Hello.
Do you have ''Wings'' by Nautilus?

154
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,579
Well, just give me what you got.

155
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:47,579
He's an ex-Chechen terrorist.

156
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,579
They've moved into St. Pete
from Moscow too.

157
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:52,980
Grabbing up everything, brother.

158
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,180
I already told you about it.

159
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,579
Took this market.
Now he's squeezing Russians out.

160
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:02,180
And I got a piece of the action there.

161
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,099
So he came down hard. He knows we're
weak now, so he's strangling us.

162
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,779
He bought off everyone there.
And killed the ones he didn't buy up.

163
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:17,579
And so it's my turn, Danny.
If I don't pay...

164
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,579
So it's either him or us.
That's how it is, brother.

165
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:33,380
He loves walking around the market
during the day.

166
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,579
Inspects his holdings, the creep.

167
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:38,779
This is the best place.

168
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,380
His bodyguards are always with him:
two or three guerillas.

169
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,779
All darkies. With rods. Beasts.

170
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,380
All in all, the job's not easy.

171
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,980
You size things up and think
how you'll make your exit.

172
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,299
I'd better give the money to you.
Two thousand bucks.

173
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,779
Don't come to my place anymore,
it's dangerous.

174
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,579
If something comes up, give me a ring.

175
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:07,299
Here's a barrel and a clip.
That's another six hundred.

176
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,579
-We'll settle up later.
- I'll get by.

177
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:42,180
Hello. It's us.
The Tatar wasn't there.

178
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:52,180
- How much for potatoes?
- One and a half.

179
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,380
How's business?

180
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:30,980
Ah, who cares?

181
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,900
Only that thug and his pals are here,
looking for you.

182
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:38,980
Listen, German. I need a room.

183
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,180
A small one. Downtown.
In a quiet neighborhood.

184
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,299
Ask your people, okay?

185
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,099
Here.

186
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,180
Thanks.

187
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:01,180
- Did you find your brother?
- I found him.

188
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,380
-Who is it?
- It's me, Zinka. Open up.

189
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:29,380
Zinka? Who the heck's Zinka?
Get outta here, whore.

190
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,900
Have you lost your fucking mind, old
man? Open up! It's me, Zinka!

191
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:37,180
What a fool! His brain's rotted!

192
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,579
-What do you want?
- I brought you a lodger.

193
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,180
Get it out!

194
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,299
People walking around...

195
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:08,180
So, old man, you got all mangy here
without me?

196
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,579
Hey, you, kind sir!

197
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,299
Buy a watermelon.

198
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:44,579
- Is it good?
- Sure! Look what a beauty!

199
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:49,180
-Yesterday I ate 7 of them myself.
- Okay.

200
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,579
- How much?
- Only six thousand.

201
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,900
Thanks. Enjoy it!

202
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,299
Lord! What's going on?

203
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
There, the guy with the watermelon!

204
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,180
Maybe you need help, huh?

205
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:03,980
I'm outta here. Keep driving.
I'll find you.

206
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,380
It wasn't the Tatar. A young guy.

207
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,900
He did everything first class.
A real pro.

208
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:50,099
The Chechen kicked the bucket,
and that guy just walked off.

209
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:53,579
He hopped in a yellow tram
and was off.

210
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:55,779
I winged him, the motherfucker.

211
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,180
But the bitch greased Pinecone.

212
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,380
Pinecone? Whacked him dead?

213
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,299
Don't know. They took him
to the hospital.

214
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,180
Why were you shooting
if it wasn't the Tatar?

215
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,180
Well, you know, I...

216
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,380
It's the Tatar we have to pay.

217
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,579
You shit-for-brains!

218
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,180
But that the new guy whacked
Pinecone is fine.

219
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,099
They won't suspect us.

220
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,579
Well, Tatar!..

221
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:34,180
His life hangs by a thread,
but he thinks about the bread.

222
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:44,980
We should take you to the hospital.

223
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:48,180
I can't go to the hospital, German.

224
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:57,579
It's okay, German...
We'll get through.

225
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,980
Zinka! Zinka!

226
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,980
If I'd met you outside Kursk
in '43...

227
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:24,380
- Beat it, old fool. What do you want?
- Come here.

228
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:30,780
Get some more vodka, strong stuff,

229
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:36,099
and bandages at the drugstore,
and... streptomycin.

230
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,380
And antibiotics.

231
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,380
And get something for Gramps,
so he stops pestering us.

232
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,179
Okay.

233
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:06,579
You're a smart man, German.

234
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:12,579
Tell me: what do we live for?

235
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,780
Well, everyone decides himself.

236
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:19,579
There's this saying:

237
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:23,579
''What's good forthe Russian
is death for the German.''

238
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,980
I live to disprove this.

239
00:35:32,179 --> 00:35:34,179
Do you have a gal?

240
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,179
What about Zinka?

241
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:45,179
It's probably 'cause of her
you took a shot in the eye?

242
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:54,179
Never mind.

243
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:00,380
You're a good man, German.

244
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,579
They closed the kiosk downstairs.

245
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:56,179
Why'd you stop? Let's roll.

246
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,380
What's with your face?

247
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:09,179
My husband.

248
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:12,579
Maybe I can help?

249
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,179
I'll deal with it.

250
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:22,380
That fellow-traveller you had
the other day, where's he?

251
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:28,300
He jumped off.
On the corner of Sredny and 18th.

252
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,300
- He rode for a long time.
-A long time.

253
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:37,579
Why didn't you call the police?

254
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:40,980
He's a good shot.

255
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,380
Can't argue with that.

256
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:52,099
Well, look, if you lied
I'll punish you.

257
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:04,380
Happy is not the man with money, but
the man whose wife sleeps in his bed.

258
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,780
Good day.

259
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:02,579
Hey! Where you been? Nautilus
came out with a new disc.

260
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,900
It's called ''Chinapple''.
They've all been snatched up.

261
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:10,300
But, on the other hand, there's also...

262
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,380
I'll take it.

263
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,179
Tatar? It's me.

264
00:39:57,099 --> 00:40:00,380
We need to meet.
We have some business to discuss.

265
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,380
Who did that to you?

266
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:01,579
My husband. When he gets drunk...

267
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:05,579
They were looking for you.

268
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,300
I said that you jumped off on Sredny.

269
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:15,380
- How's your wound? Healed up?
-Yeah, it's okay.

270
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,780
I feel hungry.

271
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,780
May be we can go to my place?

272
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,380
And your old man?

273
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:30,579
In the can.

274
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:35,179
-What's your name?
- Danila.

275
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,099
I'm Sveta.

276
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:02,579
This is ''play''.

277
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:05,980
And ''stop'' is here.

278
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,579
You can rewind and fastforward.

279
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,780
And this is volume.

280
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,380
Got it?

281
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,579
Got it?

282
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,780
- Gimme the telephone.
-What?

283
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:29,380
- The telephone.
- The neighbors will pick it up.

284
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:33,300
Gimme the phone! I need to make
a call!

285
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,380
Your husband?

286
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:57,579
- Come on, tell me about it.
- I don't want to.

287
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,780
Hello.

288
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:31,579
Hello, brother.
Gimme the money, okay?

289
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:35,579
Danny! I looked everywhere for you.
Where are you?

290
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:39,300
Hello, brother? The line's bad.

291
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,179
Call me back: 311-0536. Okay?

292
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:16,380
Hello, Danny!
Well, brother, what the hell?

293
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:18,980
Where'd you disappear to?

294
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:22,179
Is everything okay?
Come on over right now.

295
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,900
Grab some wheels on the double.

296
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,380
No. I'm going to a concert today.
Nautilus is playing.

297
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,780
I'll drop by tomorrow.

298
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:49,099
Okay, don't pout.

299
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:54,179
Maybe I'll tell you sometime.

300
00:44:55,699 --> 00:44:57,980
All right, come on, we're late.

301
00:45:57,699 --> 00:45:59,579
- Hi.
- Hi.

302
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,780
-You've turned onto smack?
- Uh-huh.

303
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:07,380
- I thought you didn't like this music?
- It's just a scene.

304
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:10,780
l see you got some new threads.
Did you get a hold of some dough?

305
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,900
Tomorrow I'm getting a wad.

306
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:17,980
I know where to get some cool ganja.
Here, call me.

307
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:22,380
- Is this your mom?
- No.

308
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:23,980
Well, okay. Later.

309
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,900
-Who was that little tart?
-An acquaintance.

310
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,980
You did a fine job, brother.

311
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:43,179
You saved my ass and helped people.

312
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,179
Now only Russians will sell there.

313
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:52,179
-And Germans?
-What do you mean, Germans?

314
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,900
-Will there be Germans there?
-What kind of Germans?

315
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:02,980
-You know, Germans.
-Why Germans?

316
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:12,900
I've got this proposal for you,
brother.

317
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:16,380
Let's open a firm:
''The Bagrov Brothers''.

318
00:47:16,699 --> 00:47:17,980
How's that sound?

319
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,579
Well, tell me, you like it?

320
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,579
-What will we do?
- Business. Basically everything.

321
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,980
But the main thing is that we've got
a problem. There's competition.

322
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:39,380
''Roundhead''. That's his nickname.

323
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,780
Huh? It's a surprise.

324
00:47:57,099 --> 00:47:58,980
Well, should I come?

325
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,380
Can we listen to your discs
on that thing?

326
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:26,099
We can.

327
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,500
-Which button is ''play''?
- The green one.

328
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,780
-What's this?
- The Nautilus anniversary concert.

329
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,900
A rare find. I got it.

330
00:48:43,099 --> 00:48:46,380
There's Shevchuk, Kinchev,
Nastya, everybody here.

331
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:20,980
Yes?

332
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:27,980
No, I can't today.

333
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,500
I'm relaxing. Yeah.

334
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,179
I said no!

335
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:39,579
l haven't got time to haggle with you.
That's it. Bye.

336
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,579
Your husband?

337
00:49:49,699 --> 00:49:53,780
No, that was my coworker.
She asked me to take her shift.

338
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:02,579
Those assholes, they slipped me
a pirated copy.

339
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,780
Where did you serve?

340
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,380
At HQ.

341
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:31,579
-Who are you?
- I'm Danila. And who're you?

342
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:35,300
Me? Pavel Yevgrafovich.
And Sveta... Where's she?

343
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:38,579
Sveta?
She's not here.

344
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:43,579
But you, Pavel Yevgrafovich,
listen to me carefully.

345
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:46,780
You're going to give me the keys now

346
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:51,900
and forget this address
and telephone number forever.

347
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,380
Ah, fancy pants!

348
00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:02,179
Why you hitting me in the balls?

349
00:52:04,099 --> 00:52:05,579
The keys!

350
00:52:13,099 --> 00:52:15,579
I see you again one more time
and I'll kill you.

351
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:18,780
We'll see who does who.

352
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:24,300
Kat? Hi. It's Danila.

353
00:52:27,099 --> 00:52:28,579
Remember, the guy with the Walkman?

354
00:52:30,699 --> 00:52:33,179
You gave me your number
at the concert.

355
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:38,579
You said when I got some money,
we'd party.

356
00:52:40,179 --> 00:52:41,699
Yeah, I've got money.

357
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,780
Oh, it's you?

358
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:02,699
And I thought: what Danila?
What Walkman?

359
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,780
Gimme the dough.

360
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,179
Here.

361
00:53:12,699 --> 00:53:15,579
What'll it be? Half dose each?
Should we get wasted?

362
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,780
What they singing about?

363
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:05,579
What the fuck do you care?
They sing like gods.

364
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:10,579
I don't like it.

365
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,579
He gets high on Nautilus,
the dickhead.

366
00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:56,980
Your American music is shit.

367
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:04,900
I said: the music is shit.
And don't you argue.

368
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:11,380
Yeah, and you too... Soon your
entire America's going to bite it.

369
00:55:16,099 --> 00:55:19,099
We're going to wipe the smiles
off all your fucking faces.

370
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,380
You got it?

371
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,980
-Why you hassling him. He's French.
- Big difference.

372
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:42,179
- Do you have contraceptives?
-What for?

373
00:55:42,699 --> 00:55:45,579
You think I'm going
to give you money?

374
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,380
Ah, Jean has some.

375
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:12,980
-What you doing that for?
- So I won't lose my head.

376
00:56:13,179 --> 00:56:14,579
Let's go.

377
00:56:33,099 --> 00:56:37,300
- Hello.
- Danny? Help me out, brother.

378
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:42,380
I've got sick. You need to roll right
away and deal with it for me.

379
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:47,579
Behind the Baltic Hotel,
on Basil's Island, at five.

380
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:52,780
There'll be this Volvo. Two guys.
They'll explain everything.

381
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:57,699
They ain't having any brains,
and you'll see yourself what's what.

382
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:03,380
Brother, I ain't got any brains
either. My skull's killing me.

383
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:10,179
Brother, if you don't help me out,
it's the end of me.

384
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,780
Help me.

385
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,780
This is part of our business.

386
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,579
I can't talk about it on the phone,
Danny.

387
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,980
Take everything with you. Don't
worry about the money. Help me out.

388
00:57:22,179 --> 00:57:23,380
Okay.

389
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,300
Hello, thugs!

390
00:58:04,699 --> 00:58:07,179
We only found the creep yesterday.

391
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,780
Turned out to be tough.
Been hiding for almost six months.

392
00:58:12,099 --> 00:58:14,980
Now he's back,
living with a friend.

393
00:58:16,179 --> 00:58:18,579
l think we should stand inside
the front door and wait for him.

394
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,780
All three of us?

395
00:58:24,099 --> 00:58:26,579
Hey, do you have any aspirin?

396
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,179
No.

397
00:58:28,699 --> 00:58:34,179
There's a back entrance to the flat
and an exit up to the attic.

398
00:58:34,699 --> 00:58:36,579
We can do it there.

399
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,980
Why are there three of us?

400
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:43,179
Me and Flatiron are together...

401
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,980
Are they packing heat?

402
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:52,380
And what do you think?
The dough they've swiped.

403
00:59:07,699 --> 00:59:09,380
Ring the bell.

404
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,300
Makar, is that you?

405
00:59:18,099 --> 00:59:22,579
Quiet, creep.
On the floor! On the floor!

406
00:59:28,579 --> 00:59:30,699
-Where is he?
-Who?

407
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,579
You didn't understand, bitch?

408
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,179
He went to the metro, for vodka.

409
00:59:38,699 --> 00:59:40,579
Don't shoot. You don't have to shoot.

410
00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:43,579
There's no one here.

411
00:59:46,699 --> 00:59:48,579
Well, we'll see, creep.

412
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,579
Flatiron, tie him up.

413
01:00:12,699 --> 01:00:14,579
Don't walk by the window.

414
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:33,980
You got any music?

415
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:36,780
Got any music?

416
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:11,579
Hit the floor!

417
01:01:13,179 --> 01:01:17,980
Guys, I probably got the wrong flat.
I probably need the next floor.

418
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:19,699
It's not him.

419
01:01:25,699 --> 01:01:27,699
Who is he?

420
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,900
-What's your name?
- Stepan.

421
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,780
Don't be afraid, Stepan.
We won't touch you.

422
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:46,300
You just sit tight
and don't move a muscle.

423
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,780
Okay.

424
01:01:49,699 --> 01:01:53,780
-What do you do?
- I'm a director. For Radio One.

425
01:01:54,099 --> 01:01:59,579
A director? I saw a director once.
He was shooting this video...

426
01:02:00,099 --> 01:02:01,980
They're all fags.

427
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:06,980
Nobody here's going to lay a finger
on you. I give you my word.

428
01:02:08,179 --> 01:02:10,179
You sit tight.

429
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,380
We're waiting for a comrade of ours.
We'll have a little chat with him,

430
01:02:12,699 --> 01:02:14,579
then let you go right away.

431
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:17,579
You make a wrong move, bitch,
and I'll shoot you in the eye.

432
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:23,579
Stepan, you wouldn't have any aspirin?

433
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:28,179
No? Too bad.

434
01:02:31,699 --> 01:02:34,179
Watch out, I'll take your head off,
bitch!

435
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:46,780
Say it's your birthday. Your birthday.

436
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:50,179
It's my birthday.

437
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:57,579
- How long it takes to walk from
the metro? - Fifteen minutes.

438
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:06,380
If he's not here in five minutes,
it's all over for you.

439
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:11,980
Quiet!

440
01:03:13,699 --> 01:03:16,380
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

441
01:03:16,699 --> 01:03:18,579
- Is the party here?
- No.

442
01:03:19,099 --> 01:03:22,780
Slava, I told you:
the top floor and on the left.

443
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:24,780
Oh. Excuse me.

444
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,099
I'll be right back.

445
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,380
Quiet, creep!

446
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:50,300
Bon appetit!

447
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:58,980
- Hello, eagles!
- Hi!

448
01:04:02,179 --> 01:04:05,579
-Watch out, don't fall!
- Give me your hand.

449
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:08,579
- Hello!
- Hey!

450
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,579
What do you want?

451
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:25,780
Do you have any aspirin?

452
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:29,579
- My skull is splitting.
-You should drink vodka.

453
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,380
No, I need aspirin.

454
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,579
Well, if that's the case, let's go.

455
01:04:58,179 --> 01:04:59,579
Let me through.

456
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,300
Here, get cured.

457
01:05:15,179 --> 01:05:17,579
Can I sit here a little while?

458
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,579
Of course, sit down.

459
01:06:35,699 --> 01:06:39,579
You wanted to blow?
They nearly took us out.

460
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:44,300
If I wanted to blow,
I'd have blown.

461
01:06:50,699 --> 01:06:52,780
All right, we'll leave by the back
entrance.

462
01:06:54,699 --> 01:06:57,579
Flatiron, take care of that one.

463
01:07:00,699 --> 01:07:02,179
Wait a minute. I'll do it myself.

464
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,699
Gimme that.

465
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,980
Oh, a pistol.

466
01:07:22,099 --> 01:07:25,579
Quiet, quiet.
We had an agreement.

467
01:07:28,699 --> 01:07:31,579
That's that. It's all over. Let go.

468
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:34,579
Come on, come on. Calm down.

469
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,380
You see it's okay?

470
01:07:52,099 --> 01:07:55,099
I don't like directors very much.

471
01:07:55,699 --> 01:07:57,980
No, you're okay, a regular guy.

472
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:08,579
Hey, do you know Butusov?
Yeah?

473
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:16,579
I like his music very much.

474
01:08:18,699 --> 01:08:22,380
Is it true they put out a new album,
''Chinapple''?

475
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:25,579
- Do you have it?
-Yes.

476
01:08:25,779 --> 01:08:29,579
Hey, be a pal and let me tape it, huh?

477
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,300
My name's Danila.

478
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,380
You'll help me, okay?

479
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,979
Well, can I go now?

480
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:16,180
Let's go have a drink.

481
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,579
Zinka!

482
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:37,699
This is my friend, Stepan.

483
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,779
Well, I'll be going?

484
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,979
Okay.

485
01:10:58,699 --> 01:11:00,579
Come and stop by.

486
01:11:00,779 --> 01:11:03,180
Sorry that it turned out this way.

487
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,979
Why are you staring?

488
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:26,180
I saved good people.
And that weakling overthere too.

489
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:32,180
God be your judge.

490
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:40,380
German, they're over in the crypt
by the fence.

491
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,380
Give them a decent burial.

492
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:06,579
- Good day!
- Hi!

493
01:12:06,779 --> 01:12:11,579
-Your husband home?
- He's on a business trip.

494
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,380
When hubby's away, the wife does play.

495
01:12:14,699 --> 01:12:16,979
Shall we come in? Standing here's
is not Russian way.

496
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:33,380
I asked you not to deceive your
husband. It's not Christian.

497
01:12:33,699 --> 01:12:38,180
I really don't know where he lives
and what he's doing.

498
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,579
Everything's clean.

499
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:45,180
He was here for two days.
He found me himself.

500
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:49,579
I kicked him out.
I'm telling you the truth.

501
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,779
If you like your honey sweet,
you should like the bees indeed.

502
01:13:00,899 --> 01:13:07,380
Let me go, creeps!
Don't touch me, scum!

503
01:13:07,699 --> 01:13:09,380
Let me go!

504
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:12,579
Ouch! I'll kill you, bitch!

505
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:15,779
- Scum!
- Lie down!

506
01:14:42,699 --> 01:14:44,300
I'll kill the motherfucker!

507
01:14:50,699 --> 01:14:56,579
Your people stopped by.
They asked for you.

508
01:14:59,699 --> 01:15:02,579
I really don't know
who you are and where you live.

509
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,380
They didn't believe me.

510
01:15:19,699 --> 01:15:23,180
Their chief had a round mug,

511
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,579
talked in proverbs.

512
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:30,779
Shall we sing a song?

513
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,979
I'm tone deaf.

514
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,180
Yeah, I understand.

515
01:15:44,699 --> 01:15:48,300
You say he served at HQ?
As a clerk?

516
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:53,899
First Pinecone, then two more
disappeared.

517
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,979
And now the Mole.
Simple like that.

518
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:13,579
You live, you learn,
you live and learn.

519
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:21,779
Yeah. Danny, is that you?
What happened?

520
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:26,579
Something happened, brother.
You alone?

521
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:31,380
Good. I'll be there soon
and tell you everything.

522
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,579
He's coming.

523
01:16:59,779 --> 01:17:02,779
-What do you want?
- Gramps, sell me your rifle.

524
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:05,979
-A million.
- Bring it out.

525
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,579
Give me the money first.

526
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,979
- Dollars!
- There's a million two hundred here.

527
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:19,579
Drag out all the shells.

528
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,779
Five caliber. For ducks.

529
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:43,579
You lie here quiet, I'll let you go.

530
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,100
All right. I got it.

531
01:21:08,979 --> 01:21:13,180
Guns on the floor! Hands behind your
heads! Lie down, mugs on the floor!

532
01:21:47,779 --> 01:21:49,180
Viktor, get up.

533
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,579
Don't shoot, brother. Please.

534
01:21:52,779 --> 01:21:55,180
What you saying, brother? Come on,
get up, it's over.

535
01:21:55,699 --> 01:22:00,579
Forgive me, brother.
Don't shoot, please. Don't kill me.

536
01:22:00,779 --> 01:22:05,579
Brother. You're my brother.
You were like a father to me.

537
01:22:07,699 --> 01:22:11,380
I even called you papa.

538
01:22:13,699 --> 01:22:15,979
You remember how I cut my leg
when we went fishing?

539
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:18,579
You dragged me home,
ten kilometers.

540
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:26,180
Remember how I got scared of a cat-
fish? And you just laughed at me?

541
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:32,699
You promised.

542
01:22:34,899 --> 01:22:37,380
I keep my word.

543
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:42,579
And you tell your people: I'll whack
whoever touches my brother.

544
01:22:43,699 --> 01:22:44,979
Go.

545
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:50,579
- It was him who betrayed you.
- I know.

546
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:53,579
- Forgive me, brother.
- Cut it out.

547
01:22:54,699 --> 01:22:56,579
Where's the money?

548
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:02,100
In his briefcase.
He took everything, the creep.

549
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:17,579
You go home. To mama.

550
01:23:18,899 --> 01:23:23,180
She's getting old.
Needs help.

551
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:28,300
Give her the money.

552
01:23:30,979 --> 01:23:34,899
Get a job, with the police.

553
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:39,579
Uncle Kolya is the chief there,

554
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:41,979
he was dad's classmate.

555
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:48,300
They've got an opening.

556
01:23:51,899 --> 01:23:53,779
Don't take the train.

557
01:23:55,699 --> 01:23:58,180
Hitchhike out of the city.

558
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:14,180
Well, brother? So long.

559
01:24:18,699 --> 01:24:20,380
If God wills it, we'll see each other
sometime.

560
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:25,579
Did you forget, you piece of shit?

561
01:24:25,899 --> 01:24:28,779
You forgot what I told you?

562
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:33,380
-You forgot?
- Pavel!

563
01:24:33,699 --> 01:24:35,579
I'll break you of your whoring!

564
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:44,300
I'll make that fancy pants little
retard of yours eat shit!

565
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:48,180
Where is he?
Where's that asshole? Huh?

566
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:49,779
Here I am.

567
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:54,180
Ah! Mr. Cool's arrived.

568
01:24:55,699 --> 01:24:58,180
Well, brother, how we gonna
split the bitch?

569
01:24:58,699 --> 01:25:00,579
You're not my brother.

570
01:25:03,699 --> 01:25:05,180
Pavel!

571
01:25:07,699 --> 01:25:10,899
Take your hands of it!
Hold on, hold on.

572
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:13,579
It's okay, Pavel, it's okay.

573
01:25:13,779 --> 01:25:16,979
Quiet, quiet.
It's okay, Pavel.

574
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:27,180
Sveta!

575
01:25:27,779 --> 01:25:30,979
Come on, shoot!
Kill everybody, come on!

576
01:25:31,779 --> 01:25:33,779
You're the big man here!

577
01:25:33,979 --> 01:25:36,899
What's it cost you to kill a man?
You, a clerk!

578
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,100
- Sveta!
- Get out!

579
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:41,979
Get me a towel.

580
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:45,579
Sveta, I came foryou.

581
01:25:47,699 --> 01:25:51,180
I got money. Can we leave?

582
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,899
Quiet, Pavel, quiet.
We'll take care of you.

583
01:25:56,699 --> 01:25:59,579
- Sveta!
- I told you to leave.

584
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,579
Don't come here anymore.

585
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,380
I don't love you.

586
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,779
It's okay, Pavel.
Everything's going to be fine.

587
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,899
I brought you an album.

588
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:39,380
This money... since you got it...
give some... for treatment.

589
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:42,300
You see how it is...

590
01:28:03,699 --> 01:28:08,180
You said it: the city is a force.
And here everyone's weak.

591
01:28:11,699 --> 01:28:16,579
The city is a dark force. The strong
come here and become weak.

592
01:28:17,699 --> 01:28:19,579
The city takes our strength.

593
01:28:22,779 --> 01:28:24,779
And now you've fallen.

594
01:28:30,779 --> 01:28:32,579
Here, take this.

595
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:39,180
What's the problem? Take it. There's
a lot here. You'll live for a while.

596
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:46,380
What's good for the Russian
is death forthe German.

597
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:14,380
Okay, German, so long.

598
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:19,779
Thank you.

599
01:29:51,699 --> 01:29:53,579
Guys, have you seen Kat?

600
01:29:53,779 --> 01:29:56,180
Look in McDonalds.

601
01:30:19,699 --> 01:30:23,779
If it's because of the dough, you're
wasting your time. I didn't take it.

602
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:29,979
-What are you going to do?
- I don't know.

603
01:30:30,699 --> 01:30:34,500
I may go to the Pyramid, or to the
Planetarium, only it's expensive.

604
01:30:35,699 --> 01:30:37,579
Penkin's playing today.

605
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:40,180
Right now it's too early to think.

606
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:46,380
Pinocchio, dish out sixty thousand.

607
01:30:46,699 --> 01:30:49,579
We'll each take a hit of acid.
And in the evening I'll treat you.

608
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:53,979
I'm leaving town.

609
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:59,300
What did you want then?

610
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:04,180
- To say goodbye.
-Well, later.

611
01:31:12,699 --> 01:31:15,180
Take it. Go see the Penkin concert.

612
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:20,979
What's this for?

613
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:26,300
Is this for me or something?

614
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:28,500
Okay, later.

615
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:32,180
Maybe you need something?

616
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:35,579
Well, I'm outta here?

617
01:32:09,979 --> 01:32:11,899
I haven't sat out my discharge yet.

618
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,380
Where did you serve?

619
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:20,180
In HQ there, I sat out my hitch
as a clerk, you know...

620
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,380
And what do you want to be?

621
01:32:23,699 --> 01:32:27,579
Me? Don't know.
A driver.

622
01:32:33,899 --> 01:32:35,899
Hey, can I switch on some music?

623
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:38,100
I haven't listened to it for awhile.

624
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:39,699
Go ahead.

625
01:33:00,899 --> 01:33:02,779
The snow's really piled up, huh?

626
01:33:06,979 --> 01:33:08,579
Yeah.

627
01:33:12,899 --> 01:33:14,779
Where you headed?

628
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,180
To Moscow.
